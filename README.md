# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction System

A Machine Learning project that predicts the likelihood of a patient having diabetes based on medical attributes such as glucose level, BMI, age, blood pressure, and more. This system is built using Python and popular ML libraries, providing accurate predictions and an easy-to-use interface.

## 📌 Features
- ✅ **Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding.
- ✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Statistical analysis and visualizations for better insights.
- ✅ **Multiple ML Models** – Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc., with performance comparison.
- ✅ **High Accuracy** – Achieved through hyperparameter tuning.
- ✅ **User Interface** – Predict diabetes risk from user inputs (if deployed).
